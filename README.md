# Celerative-Machine-Learning-Project
This project aims to classify developers by the tools and technologies they use to work. Each project notebook demonstrates the iterative nature of the machine learning process, training and fitting each algorithm and applying feature selection and feature engineering techniques, as well as tuning algorithm hyperparameters in order to yield improved predictive performance. Initially, algorithms are tested against fewer, more generalized, classes. After baseline performance has been established, the algorithms are tested against more specific classes in order to focus in on exactly which skills, tools or technologies are useful in predicting each developer profile.
