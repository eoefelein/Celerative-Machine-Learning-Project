# Celerative-Machine-Learning-Project
This project demonstrates the iterative nature of the Machine Learning process by predicting developer profiles by their skills. Each notebook demonstrates the iterative process of training and fitting each algorithm and applies Feature Selection and Feature Engineering techniuqes, as well as Hyperparameter Tuning in order to yield improved predictive performance. The Algorithms are initially tested against datasets of fewer, more general, classes. After baseline performance has been established, the algorithms are tested against more specific classes in order to focus in on exactly which skills are useful in predicting each developer profile.
