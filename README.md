# Celerative-Machine-Learning-Project
With each notebook, this project serves to show each iteration of the Machine Learning process. Each notebook will be representative of the Machine Learning workflow, within which, machine learning algorithms are applied to the data in order to make predictions, as techniques to yield better algorithm performance are applied. In other words, each notebook contains the process of training and fitting each algorithm and applies techniques such as Feature Selection and Engineering and Hypertuning of Parameters in order to yield improved algorithm performance. Algorithms are initially tested against datasets containing fewer classes, with more classes added after baseline algorithm performance has been established.
