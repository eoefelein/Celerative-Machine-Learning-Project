# Celerative-Machine-Learning-Project
With each notebook, this project shows each iteration of the Machine Learning process. Within each notebook, machine learning algorithms are applied to the data in order to make predictions and techniques to yield better algorithm performance are applied. In this way, each notebook demonstrates the iterative process of training and fitting each algorithm and applies techniques such as Feature Selection and Feature Engineering as well as Parameter Hypertuning to yield improved algorithm performance. Algorithms are initially tested against datasets of fewer, more general, classes. After baseline algorithm performance has been established, algorithms are tested against more specific classes in order to focus in on exactly which skills are useful in predicting each developer profile.
