# Celerative-Machine-Learning-Project
This project aims to classify developers by the tools and technologies they use to work. Each notebook demonstrates the iterative nature of the machine learning process, training and fitting each algorithm and applying Feature Selection and Feature Engineering techniuqes, as well as tuning algorithm hyperparameters in order to yield improved predictive performance. Algorithms are initially tested against datasets of fewer, more generalized, classes. After baseline performance has been established, the algorithms are tested against more specific classes in order to focus in on exactly which skills are useful in predicting each developer profile.
